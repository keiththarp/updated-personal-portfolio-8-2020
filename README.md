## Technologies Used to Create SpeedQuiz
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Early Steps

This was a tough one, writing about myself and creating a design that speaks to me was challenging. I still see this as a work in progress and am looking forward to the next iteration.

## Lessons In JavaScript

The past few apps that I've built have been single page and I like the speed and quickness of them, so I decided to shift this over to that as well.

**Swapping cards**

- I was lead to the path of swapping the display of cards for the three pages from one of my earlier projects and liked it. 

**Mobile First design**

- Using the BootStrap framework helps make the design and final product a mobile friendly app from the beginning.
